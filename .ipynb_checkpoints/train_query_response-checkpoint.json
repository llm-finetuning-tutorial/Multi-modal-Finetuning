First, consider the alleles in Holly's genotype for the whisker type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nHolly's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Holly's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be straight whiskers."

        "response": "Answer: 4:0\nSolution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a hairy body or a hairless body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body hair trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a hairy body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a hairless body.\nA hairy body is the dominant allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the dominant version of the body hair trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairy body must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.\nA hairless body is the recessive allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the recessive version of the body hair trait must have only recessive alleles for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairless body must have the genotype bb.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a hairy body to offspring with a hairless body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a hairy body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairless body."

        "response": "Answer: The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.\nSolution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.\nDistance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.\nThere is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."

Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.\nSquirt's genotype of Ii has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Squirt's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be a spotted tail."

So, Zazu's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Zazu's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for pale orange cheeks (r) is recessive to the allele for bright orange cheeks (R). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.\nZazu's genotype of RR has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Zazu's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks."

        "response": "Answer: HF\nSolution: H is the symbol for hydrogen. According to the legend, hydrogen atoms are shown in light gray. F is the symbol for fluorine. According to the legend, fluorine atoms are shown in light green. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one hydrogen atom and one fluorine atom. The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and F. There is one hydrogen atom, so H will not have a subscript. There is one fluorine atom, so F will not have a subscript. The correct formula is HF. The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above."
