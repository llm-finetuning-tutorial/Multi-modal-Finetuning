The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a hairy body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a hairless body.\nA hairy body is the dominant allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the dominant version of the body hair trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairy body must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.\nA hairless body is the recessive allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the recessive version of the body hair trait must have only recessive alleles for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairless body must have the genotype bb.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a hairy body to offspring with a hairless body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a hairy body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairless body."
